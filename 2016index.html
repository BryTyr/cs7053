<h1>CS7053/CS7453 Internet security and privacy.</h1>

<p>This is the 2016 version. Last updated 20160116 by stephen.farrell@cs.tcd.ie. 
(<a href="2015index.html">last year's</a>)</p>
<ul>
  <li>The canonical URL for this stuff is: <a
    href="https://down.dsg.cs.tcd.ie/cs7053/">https://down.dsg.cs.tcd.ie/cs7053/</a>
    and the latest source is at <a href="https://github.com/sftcd/cs7053">https://github.com/sftcd/cs7053</a></li>
  <li>This course was previously <a
    href="https://down.dsg.cs.tcd.ie/cs7012/">CS7012</a> and before that <a
    href="https://down.dsg.cs.tcd.ie/nds106u1/">NDS106</a> (the links are to
    the old lectures etc.) The content overlaps a good bit.</li>
  <li>The <a href="#Lecture">Lecture slides</a> section below has links to ppt
    versions of all the lectures for the course. The <a
    href="#materials">Materials</a> section below has links to local copies of
    some of the background information/papers etc. For exam purposes, you won't
    need anything else other than these and easily available things like RFCs. (You are
    of course encouraged to read more widely).</li>
  <li>You can look at some relevant <a
    href="https://down.dsg.cs.tcd.ie/old-exams/index.html">old exams</a> with
    both questions and answers/marking schemes.</li>
  <li>There will be two assignments, totalling 20% of the marks for the module
    (so the exam is worth 80%). </li>
	<li>Note that I may be changing the slides as I go. Depending on stuff
that's more than two weeks ahead of time may be wasted effort:-)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Lecture Slides</h2>
