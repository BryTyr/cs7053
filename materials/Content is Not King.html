   <i><p>The
Internet is widely regarded as primarily a content delivery system. Yet
historically, connectivity has mattered much more than content. Even on
the Internet, content is not as important as is often claimed, since it
is e-mail that is still the true "killer app."</p>

<p>The primacy of connectivity over content explains phenomena that
have baffled wireless industry observers, such as the enthusiastic
embrace of SMS (Short Message System) and the tepid reception of WAP
(Wireless Application Protocol). Combined with statistics showing low
cell phone usage, this also suggests that the 3G systems that are about
to be introduced will serve primarily to stimulate more voice usage,
not to provide Internet access.</p>

<p>For the wired Internet, the secondary role of content will likely
mean that the dangers of balkanization are smaller than is often
feared. Further, symmetrical links to the house are likely to be in
greater demand than is usually realized. The huge sums being invested
by carriers in content are misdirected.</p></i>

 <a name="o1"></a><h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Internet is widely predicted to produce "digital convergence,"
in which computing, telecommunications, and broadcasting all merge into
a single stream of discrete bits carried on the same ubiquitous
network. The popular images of convergence are heavily tinged with the
flavor of Hollywood. "Content is king" is the universal buzzword, where
content is usually taken to mean professionally prepared material such
as books, movies, sports events, or music. The  race is supposedly to
determine which organization or alliance will dominate in providing
content to users, ideally in advanced multimedia formats. A recent
article concludes that "[the Internet] has become a mass medium used
mostly by relatively passive consumers, and as such major content
providers will dominate it" [<a href="#MargolisR">MargolisR</a>]. The book [<a href="#Winston">Winston</a>]
also presents the Internet as the next step in the evolution of mass
media. Many industry leaders appear to base their strategies on this
thesis. For example, at Global Crossing, its recent CEO, Leo Hindery,
was attempting</p>

<p></p><blockquote>to turn this global Internet-based network into a
mature content distributor. ... "I don't want to be anyone's dumb
pipes," says Hindery.  "If all you do is racks and servers, that's
dumb. What we're doing is melding the network and the content." [<a href="#Krause">Krause</a>]</blockquote><p></p>

<p>This preoccupation with content is not peculiar to North America.
Norio Ohga, once CEO and recently chairman of Sony, says that
"[w]ithout content, the network is nothing" [<a href="#Schlender">Schlender</a>].
Juan Villalonga, until recently the chairman of the dominant Spanish
communications carrier Telefónica, based his strategy on the belief
that "[t]he key ... is content. Without it, ... phone companies risk
becoming simple commodity pipelines" [<a href="#Baker">Baker</a>].</p>

<p>Unfortunately for these companies, content is not the key. Content
certainly has all the glamor. What content does not have is money. This
might seem absurd. After all, the media trumpet the hundred million
dollar opening weekends of blockbuster movies, and leading actors such
as Julia Roberts or Jim Carrey earn $20 million (plus a share of the
gross) per film. That is true, and it is definitely possible to become
rich and famous in Hollywood. Yet the revenues and profits from movies
pale next to those for providing the much denigrated "pipes." The
annual movie theater ticket sales in the U.S. are well under $10
billion. The telephone industry collects that much money every two
weeks! Those "commodity pipelines" attract much more spending than the
glamorous "content."</p>

<p>In the following sections I develop the argument that connectivity
is more important than content. The evidence is based on current and
historical spending figures. I also show that the current preoccupation
with content by decision makers is not new, as similar attitudes have
been common in the past. I then make projections for the future role of
content and connectivity, and discuss implications for the architecture
of the Internet, including wireless technologies.</p>

<p><img src="Content%20is%20Not%20King_files/quad.gif" alt="++++++++++"></p>
 <a name="o2"></a><h2>Spending on content and connectivity</h2>

<p>As mentioned in the Introduction, movie theater revenues are tiny
compared to spending on communications. Of course, movie tickets are
only a small part of the movie industry revenues, and an even smaller
part of the entire content industry. This section therefore presents a
more comprehensive comparison. The final conclusion is still the same,
namely that spending on connectivity is much more important for
communication services than spending on content can ever be.</p>

<p>A reasonable objection to the comparison made below is that
investments are driven by profits, not revenues. That is true. However,
one cannot have profits without revenues. Further, profits of the
telephone industry have dwarfed those of Hollywood. Even if we look at
profitability in terms of return on investment, it is not clear that
movies have been notably more profitable than communications,
especially if one adjusts for risks. Those who invested in <a href="http://disney.go.com/">Disney</a> in the early 1980s (but not recently) have done very well, but <a href="http://www.sony.com/">Sony</a>
took a bath in its takeover of Columbia Pictures. Some creative talent
has done very well. An outstanding example is Steven Spielberg, who
became a billionaire, while minimizing his risks through careful
structuring of his deals. On the other hand, for most actors and
writers, the financial rewards are much slimmer and spottier, as
Hollywood is very much a "winner-take-all" market. In communications
the risks may also be rising, as the Iridium debacle demonstrates, but
so are potential returns. At this moment Wall Street gets attracted
primarily to the prospects for rapid growth, figuring that profits will
show up some time in the future. While the actual returns that Wall
Street seems to be expecting are almost surely ludicrously
overoptimistic, the general principle appears valid. The histories of
the telegraph and the telephone show the same pattern. Usually many
companies jumped in with unrealistic hopes, most failed, but the
industry as a whole prospered. Therefore this paper concentrates on
revenues and growth rates of various sectors of the high-tech economy, 
and what they say about the current and potential role of content.</p>

<p><a href="#tab1">Table 1</a> presents statistics that show the relative sizes of several sectors of the U.S. economy. The data was drawn primarily from [<a href="#USDOC">USDOC</a>],
and the year 1997 was the most recent for which all the relevant time
series were available. The detailed description of how the figures were
obtained is given in the the paper [<a href="#Odlyzko3">Odlyzko3</a>]. There is considerable overlap in different categories in <a href="#tab1">Table 1</a>.
For example, the $187.5 billion of advertising industry revenues pays
for almost all television broadcasting, and that provides much of the
funding for the movie industry. Further, consumer expenditures on phone
services are already contained completely in the general telephone
industry figure. Some of the categories, such as sporting goods and
airlines, are included just for illustration.</p>

<p>What is striking is how highly valued communications is. If we
combine the revenues of the phone industry with those of the postal
service, we obtain a figure larger than military spending, and almost
three times higher than the revenues of the airline industry. Just the
spending on phone services is higher than all advertising outlays. So
say good-bye to all those plans for financing the Internet through
advertising! Yes, advertising can help fund some services, but it will
not provide the generous revenue streams that are needed to support a
communications infrastructure as large as the phone system. To obtain
the funding that many dot-coms seem to be planning on, it will be
necessary to get contributions from more than advertising. E-commerce
can help, but even that probably will not be enough, and it will be
necessary to persuade people to pay for a large chunk of their
communications. The question is, what are people willing to pay for?</p>

<p><a href="#tab1">Table 1</a> shows that some advertising-supported
business models might indeed be feasible.  For example, sales of
recorded music come to about $15 billion per year. If one eliminates
the overhead costs of the physical distribution system for CDs
(including music stores), one could probably provide the artists with
as much money as they make now, and the music labels with as much
revenue for their central selection and promotional activities (and
their profit) as they make now for under half of the $15 billion. That
would be about half of the advertising revenues that the radio industry
collects for broadcasting music. Getting that much extra funding from
advertising might be possible for an Internet music service that
allowed listeners much greater selectivity and thereby led to more
listening (as <a href="http://www.napster.com/">Napster</a> appears to
be doing on college campuses). However, such a move appears feasible
only because recorded music is a relatively small market. We could not
hope to obtain enough advertising funding to pay for anything as large
as the phone system.</p>

<p>Although <a href="#tab1">Table 1</a> makes a powerful case by itself,
it is worth reiterating the basic theme, which is that the vaunted
"content" is not where the action is. The postal system alone collects
almost as much money as the entire movie industry, even though the
latter benefits from large foreign sales. For all the publicity it
attracts, entertainment is simply not all that large, because  people
are not willing to pay very much for it. The dream of the early 1990s
of financing the "Information Superhighway" through "500 channels to
the home on the cable TV network" was an obvious fantasy.</p>

<p>Content is not only a small part of the economy, it is often paid
for indirectly. Well over two thirds of newspaper revenues, and almost
all of broadcast TV and radio revenues come from advertising. Thus
content is being given away in order to attract people to goods and
services they are willing to pay for. Although spending for content
(whether by consumers or advertisers) has been rising, it has been
doing so at a sedate pace, and is unlikely to explode.</p>

<p>One could object that <a href="#tab1">Table 1</a> proves just the
opposite of what is claimed above. After all, this table shows that
even if no single content segment collects anywhere near as much money
as the phone system, in aggregate huge sums of money are being spent on
content. In particular, household spending on content is over 50%
higher than on phone services. There is some issue of what one means by
content, a question we will return to later. If we take a generous
interpretation, we can come up with total content industry revenues
comparable to the $256 billion that the telephone industry collected in
1997. (This would include household spending as well as business
information services and advertising revenues of broadcast industries.)
However, comparing just the total revenues of those two industries is
misleading. In the case of the telephone industry, the $256 billion
does include some service revenues as well as yellow pages advertising,
but the overwhelming majority of that money is for simple transport of
voice and data. The content industry as a whole, though, has to use its
revenues to pay for content as well as the delivery of the content. The
creative souls who command $20 million per movie know their value, and
do manage to appropriate the lion's share of the profits from such
enterprises, while keeping their risks lower than those of the
investors. Similarly, the professionals who compile the Lexis database,
or assemble and monitor Reuters' financial data feeds, have to be paid,
just like movie actors and musicians. Even if their average pay is
lower, there are more of them, and their payroll, as well as all the
equipment and overhead needed to support their work, are not
inexpensive. Hence only some of the revenues of the content industry
contribute to the communications infrastructure. Since this work is
concerned with the future of the Internet, it is the present and
potential funding for the network that matters.</p>

<p>That only a fraction of the revenues of the content industry go for
delivery is an important point that has analogs in the context of
e-commerce. E-commerce is already big, and is exploding. However, what
does that mean for the network? A dollar of e-commerce transactions
does not mean a dollar devoted to the network. When that sterling
example of e-commerce, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon.com</a>,
sold $1.6 billion of goods (primarily books) in 1999, it is likely that
only a few million dollars of the $2.3 billion of its costs went for
Internet connectivity. Considerably more, but (judging from its
financial reports) still only around $150 million, went for the
servers, software development, and other information technology
products and services that are needed to stay competitive in this
rapidly changing field. If the Amazon figure of $1.6 billion is to
represent the e-commerce opportunity for the Internet, then t-commerce
("t" standing for "telephone", and covering all deals that use the
phone in any way) amounts to tens of trillions of dollars. (Yes, more
than the GDP, since the wonderful accounting of the e-commerce world
surely would let us count the same value several times, as it passes
through multiple transactions that all use the telephone at some
stage.) The contribution of e-commerce to communications is growing,
but it has to be kept in perspective.</p>

<p>Communications is far from being the largest segment of the economy.
It is smaller than cars, housing, food, and especially medicine. It is
also about two thirds the size of the primary and secondary education
sectors, and comparable to the higher education enterprise. The main
point, though, is that communications is huge, and represents the
collective decisions of millions of people about what they want. It is
also growing relative to the rest of the economy in a process that goes
back centuries. As a fraction of the U.S. economy, it has grown more
than 15-fold over the last 150 years. The key point of this section is
that most of this spending is on connectivity, the standard
point-to-point communications, and not for broadcast media that
distribute "content."</p>

<p>There is at least one prominent technology that initially moved from
connectivity towards content, namely radio. It started out as a
point-to-point communication system, the "wireless telegraph." After
about two decades of experimentation, it became primarily a broadcast
medium. (For the history of this transformation, see [<a href="#Douglas">Douglas</a>; <a href="#Smulyan">Smulyan</a>].) However, the role of radio in the economy as a content delivery technology is tiny compared to that of the telephone, as <a href="#tab1">Table 1</a>
shows. Further, in the last few decades, with the development of
cellular services, radio transmission has started to move back to its
roots as a point-to-point communications service. The revenues from
wireless telephony already far exceed those from radio broadcasting, as <a href="#tab1">Table 1</a> shows ($33.5 billion versus $13.5 billion in 1997, with the disparity much greater today).</p>

<p>The predominance of point-to-point communications spending is not
new. That has been the historical pattern for ages. For example, in the
early 19th century, almost all the revenues of the U.S. postal system
came from letters. Yet about as many newspapers as letters were being
delivered.</p>

<p><img src="Content%20is%20Not%20King_files/quad.gif" alt="++++++++++"></p>
 <a name="o3"></a><h2>History of preoccupation with content</h2>

<p>The preoccupation of decision makers with content and broadcast
communication is also not new. In the early 19th century, the explicit
policy of the U.S. government was to promote wide dissemination of
newspapers. They were regarded as the main tool for keeping citizenry
informed and engaged in building a unified nation. Hence newspaper
distribution was subsidized from profits on letters, as is discussed 
at greater length in Section 12 of [<a href="#Odlyzko3">Odlyzko3</a>].
The extent of the subsidy may be gauged by the fact that "[i]n 1832,
newspapers generated no more than 15 percent of total postal revenues,
while making up as much as 95 percent of the weight" (p. 38 of [<a href="#John">John</a>]).</p>

<p>The policy of the U.S. government to promote newspaper "content" at
the expense of person-to-person communication through letters may or
may not have been correct. It would be a hard task (and one well beyond
the scope of this work) to decide this question. However, there are
reasonable arguments that the preoccupation with newspapers harmed the
social and commercial development of the country by stifling
circulation of the informal, non-content information that people cared
about. In the 1840s, responding to public pressure, Congress did reduce
letter rates, which resulted in increased usage, and changed patterns
of usage, as is described at greater length in Section 12 of [<a href="#Odlyzko3">Odlyzko3</a>].
In those days, the government understood clearly that what people were
willing to pay for was letters, and that newspapers were being
subsidized. The Post Office would have thrived on letters alone, but
would have gone bankrupt instantly had it been forced to survive on
newspaper deliveries. Thus content was king in the minds of policy
makers, but it was definitely not king in terms of what people were
willing to pay for. That is similar to the current situation. However,
this differential in willingness to pay does not seem to be understood
as well today as it was then.</p>

<p>Preoccupation with content has historically been common. For
example, it was often thought (even by Alexander Graham Bell) that one
of the principal uses of the telephone would be in broadcasting [<a href="#deSolaP1">deSolaP1</a>; <a href="#deSolaP2">deSolaP2</a>].
Several substantial experiments in delivering content over the phone
were attempted, including the Telefon Hirmondó in Budapest that lasted
from 1893 past the end of World War I, and the Telephone Herald in
Newark, New Jersey, which folded soon after its start in 1911 [<a href="#deSolaP1">deSolaP1</a>].
In the end, though, the phone emerged as the prototypical example of
point-to-point communication. The standard history books do not explain
convincingly why this occurred. However, there is plenty of evidence
for anyone interested enough to investigate this issue. For example,
according to [<a href="#Denison">Denison</a>], the annual subscription
for Telefon Hirmondó was 18 forints (about $7.50 in U.S. currency of
that time), while regular phone service cost 150 forints per year. With
customers willing to pay over 8 times as much for connectivity as for
content, is it any wonder that the Telefon Hirmondó did not flourish?</p>

<p><img src="Content%20is%20Not%20King_files/quad.gif" alt="++++++++++"></p>
 <a name="o4"></a><h2>Content and the brave new world of the Internet</h2>

<p>A skeptical reader might say that all this historical stuff is
amusing but irrelevant. We live in the 21st century, and our high-tech
present as well as our future are on the Web, where content is
universally regarded as king. Studies of the Internet regularly find
that Web traffic makes up 60 to 80% of the bytes that are transmitted.
Certainly most of the commercial development effort on the Internet and
almost all the attention are devoted to content. Thus even if content
was not king in the early 19th or late 20th centuries, it might be king
in the 21st.</p>

<p>There are three counterarguments to the above objection, all of which support the "content is <i>not</i>
king" thesis. All argue that the dazzling success of the Web has created
a misleading picture of what the Internet is, or is likely to evolve
towards. One argument, to be discussed in more detail later, is that 
the future of the Internet is not with the Web, but with programs like
Napster or (even more, because of its decentralized nature) Gnutella,
which allow for informal sharing of data.</p>

<p>The second argument is that content is not king of the Web. Most of
the traffic on the Internet is corporate (especially if we include
internal intranet traffic that is not visible on the public backbones).
It is likely that in early 2000, under a third of the volume went to
residential users [<a href="#CoffmanO1">CoffmanO1</a>; <a href="#CoffmanO2">CoffmanO2</a>].
Intranet traffic appears to be much less heavily biased towards the Web
than that of private individuals. Furthermore, even the traffic that
appears to be Web-based frequently represents a variety of database
transactions that are not properly speaking "content." Because browsers
are a user-friendly tool that is ubiquitous, a multitude of services
have been squeezed into a Web framework. They help perpetuate the image
of the Internet as primarily a content-delivery mechanism. (Note that
the Web was invented to allow scientists to communicate with each other
and access data, not for content delivery.)</p>

<p>The third and final argument is that even if content were king on the
Web now, the Web is <i>not</i>king
of the Internet. This may again seem absurd, especially in view of the
statistics quoted above, that most of the Internet traffic is Web
transfers. However, consider again the U.S. postal system of 1832.
Content certainly dominated in terms of volume of data. Newspapers sent
by mail weighed about 20 times as much as letters. Further, the density
of printed matter is higher than of handwriting, and a typical copy of
a newspaper was likely read many more times than a typical letter.
Hence newspaper "content" was probably delivering at least a hundred
times as much information as letters. But volume is not the same as
value. Letters were bringing in 85% of the money needed to run the
postal system in 1832. On the Internet in 2000, it is e-mail that is
king, even if its volume is small.</p>

<p>Today, Web traffic dominates the Internet in volume, with about 20
times as many bytes as e-mail. (Netnews traffic volume is of about the
same order of magnitude as e-mail. The fractions of total traffic
created by these two services vary from link to link and from day to
day.) Even a decade ago, before the Web, e-mail typically accounted for
under 10% of Internet volume. Yet e-mail has been and continues to be
the real "killer app" of the Internet. The ARPANET (the progenitor of
the Internet) was built primarily to connect computers. Yet e-mail
quickly emerged as the application that mattered the most to users,
even in the early days of the network. This was much to the surprise of
the system's designers [<a href="#LickliderV">LickliderV</a>].</p>

<p></p><blockquote>The popularity of e-mail was not foreseen by the
ARPANET's planners. Roberts had not included electronic mail in the
original blueprint for the network. In fact, in 1967 he had called the
ability to send messages between users "not an important motivation for
a network of scientific computers" ... Why then was the popularity of
e-mail such a surprise? One answer is that it represented a radical
shift in the ARPANET's identity and purpose. The rationale for building
the network had focused on providing access to computers rather than to
people. [<a href="#Abbate">Abbate</a>]</blockquote><p></p>

<p>More recent surveys (e.g. [<a href="#KatzA">KatzA</a>; <a href="#Pew">Pew</a>])
show that e-mail is still the most valuable service.  Ask people
whether they would rather give up e-mail or the phone, and the
responses will typically be split. However, when a similar choice is
offered between the Web and e-mail, there is no contest. This is true
for both individuals and large organizations. Intranets are all the
rage, but it is e-mail that makes enterprises run.</p>
 <p>The perception that content dominates the Internet is fueled by studies such as [<a href="#AdamicH">AdamicH</a>],
which show the winner-take-all phenomenon, with a few sites dominating
Web transactions among residential users. However, one should not read
too much into such results. In the early 19th century postal system,
studies of usage of information would undoubtedly have reached
conclusions similar to those of [<a href="#AdamicH">AdamicH</a>]. Most
data from distant locations that people consumed came from newspapers.
Further, circulation figures of individual newspapers probably followed
the standard Zipf-type distribution, with the most popular papers
attracting a disproportionately high fraction of readers. Yet that does
not say much about the value derived from the postal system, which was
elsewhere, in letters.</p>

<p>To reemphasize the importance of point-to-point communication in the
online environment, consider the disappointing reception that WebTV has
had. It seems that inexpensive Web browsing is not such a great
attraction by itself. Also consider the innumerable failures in
teletext experiments (cf. [<a href="#Ettema">Ettema</a>; <a href="#Greenberg">Greenberg</a>; <a href="#Klopfenstein">Klopfenstein</a>; <a href="#Noll">Noll</a>]),
as well as the initially promising start but disappointing end of the
French Minitel. Their inadequate or even totally missing facilities for
point-to-point communication appear to have been fatal errors. Next,
consider the fates of <a href="http://www.compuserve.com/">CompuServe</a> and <a href="http://www.prodigy.com/">Prodigy</a>.
Set up primarily for database access and online shopping, respectively,
both were forced to emphasize communications and are now basically
standard ISPs. Finally, the currently most successful of the public
online  services, <a href="http://www.aol.com/">AOL</a>, started out as a game network. The figure in <a href="#tab1">Table 1</a>
showing small video game spending explains why that approach was doomed
to failure. (The game market is growing, and in any case is larger than
the figure in <a href="#tab1">Table 1</a>, which covers just the home
part of it. It can certainly contribute to profits of large networks,
or support some specialized service providers. However, it simply
cannot fund anything as large as AOL.) AOL survived and prospered
because it was nimble. After several changes in strategy, it partially
opened itself up to the Internet. While it has content of its own, and
access to the Internet, the majority of the time its subscribers spend
online is devoted to e-mail and chat.</p> What this argument suggests is
that the Web (and browsers in particular, which made the Web
user-friendly) may have created a misleading impression. By focusing
attention on centralized delivery of content, the Web may have
prevented a proper appreciation of the importance of the often chaotic
and generally unplannable point-to-point communications. The Web and
the browsers may have played two main roles. One was to force online
service providers to accept an open interoperable standard that made
the entire Internet accessible for communications for everyone. The
other was to introduce a user-friendly graphical interface for e-mail,
chat, and netnews, which made such communications easier. However, the
Web is  not as important to the Internet as is commonly thought.<p></p>

<p>As an example of the relative value of content and simple pipes,
note that the revenues of the entire cable TV industry in 1997 were
only slightly higher than for the cell phone carriers. Furthermore, as <a href="#tab1">Table 2</a>
shows, cable TV has been growing far more slowly than the wireless
industry. Yet cell phones currently provide primarily simple, low
bandwidth pipes. By early 2000, even the gross revenues of radio
telephony exceeded those of the cable TV industry. Further, a large
chunk (estimated at a quarter to a third) of cable revenues was devoted
to paying for content, so in terms of basic network revenues, the
cellular industry had pulled ahead even before 1997. The comparison is
even more favorable to low bandwidth wireless pipes when we go outside
the U.S. In other industrialized countries, cell phones are often much
more widely used, while cable TV penetration is almost always far lower
than in the U.S. Thus on a worldwide scale, the comparison is skewed
even more heavily against content. The cable TV industry does have
excellent prospects for faster growth. However, that growth will surely
come more from improved communication capabilities, and less from
content.</p>

<p>Although the wireless industry has done very well selling low
bandwidth pipes for connectivity, it appears determined to repeat the
mistakes of the previous communications technologies in the near
future. In particular, this industry appears preoccupied with content.
The new third generation (3G) systems that will be introduced around
the world in the next few years will provide considerably higher
bandwidth than current ones. This bandwidth is universally touted as a
way to provide Internet access, and in particular to sell content to
users. Yet the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP), designed to deliver
content to wireless devices, has been a disappointment so far,
surprising the industry. On the other hand, the Short Message System
(SMS), providing low bandwidth digital messaging between users, has
surprised observers by its success. For example, in the U.K., between
the second quarter of calendar year 1999 and the second quarter of
2000, the number of SMS messages grew from 159 million to 1.42 billion [<a href="#Oftel">Oftel</a>].
Yet in view of history, there should have been no surpise here at all.
SMS provides connectivity, WAP provides content. Therefore it is
completely consistent with all of human history, and should have been
completely predictable, for SMS to be more popular than WAP.</p>

<p>What should the cellular operators do? They should be striving to
increase voice calls on their systems. Although this is not widely
known, cell phones are used very infrequently. For example, in the
U.K., average usage of a cell phone dropped from 4.8 minutes per
subscriber per day in the second quarter of 1999 to 4.2 minutes a year
later [<a href="#Oftel">Oftel</a>]. (To be more precise, the drop was
from 3.5 minutes of outgoing calls and 1.3 minutes of incoming calls to
3.2 and 1.0 minutes, respectively. Similar drops, and similar average
usage figures, apply also to many other countries, including Denmark,
Finland, and New Zealand.)  At the same time, the average usage of a
wired phone in the U.K. increased from 15.7 minutes of outgoing calls
per day in 1999 to 17.3 minutes a year later. Although up to a third of
the wired minutes are for Internet access, this does show that wired
phone usage is far higher than that of cell phones. The reason for the
drop in average daily usage is that new subscribers are being recruited
largely through the pre-paid plans, which tend to limit usage.</p>

<p>The low usage of cell phones refutes the frequently heard claims
that wireless telephones are beginning to displace wired ones. Given
the higher growth rates in wireless minutes than in wired ones, such a
displacement will likely occur, but it is still far in the future. At
this moment, wired phone usage is growing. In the U.K., for example,
looking at the data in [<a href="#Oftel">Oftel</a>],
we see that between the second calendar quarters of 1999 and 2000,
fixed line calling grew by 7.03 billion minutes, from 47.22 billion to
54.25 billion, while cell phone calling grew from 5.0 billion minutes
to 8.39 billion minutes. Thus the growth in wired phone usage over that
year was larger than the total volume of cell calls at the beginning of
that period. A closer analysis of the statistics in [<a href="#Oftel">Oftel</a>]
suggests that this growth was due entirely to increased Internet usage,
and that voice usage did drop slightly, presumably because it was
diverted to cell phones. Still, total wired usage grew vigorously. Even
if we consider just voice calls, each wired phone in Britain is used
for about 22 minutes per day for voice calls. One does not replace that
with a cell phone that is used 4 minutes per day! On the other hand, it
suggests that there is much more that can be done to stimulate voice
usage. That this is feasible is shown at least partially through the
experience of the U.S. Historically, in all countries average cell
phones usage has been decreasing steadily, as the influence of the
early heavy users has been diluted. However, recently usage in the U.S.
has increased. According to a press release from the Cellular
Telecommunications &amp; Internet Association [<a href="#CTIA">CTIA</a>],
between the last quarter of 1998 and the last quarter of 1999,
subscribers have increased their local calling from an average of 130
minutes per month in the last quarter of 1998 to 180 minutes per month
in the last quarter of 1999. (Wired phones are used for about an hour
each day in the U.S.) This increase was almost surely caused by the
spread of block pricing plans, starting with the introduction of the
AT&amp;T Digital One-Rate<sup><font ="-1">tm</font></sup> plan in 1998.
In these plans users purchase a fixed number of minutes to be used in a
month. Such plans have the effect of stimulating usage [<a href="#Odlyzko3">Odlyzko3</a>].
Their success in the U.S. demonstrates that creative pricing can be
used to increase voice usage. (For those complaining of "cell-phone
rage," this must be a frightening prospect!) In addition to generally
lower prices, as well as block pricing plans, or flat rate plans, the
industry could stimulate more voice usage through introduction of
toll-free numbers for wireless calls. If <a href="http://www.ual.com/">United Airlines</a> is willing to pay for people to call it on wired phones, shouldn't they be willing to pay for them to call from cell phones?</p>

<p>The arguments above suggest that the main role of 3G wireless
systems should be to stimulate voice usage. That is not what the
industry is planning, but the systems that are being developed are
flexible enough so that even if their intended purpose of providing
content is not lucrative, they can still be used for more voice calls.
The arguments of this paper predict that the industry will end up doing
this without planning on it. However, it would be more productive for
them to think along these lines from the beginning. In particular,
content, location based services, and related novel features are
probably best thought of as ways to induce more voice usage, through
making the cell phone more widely useful. The Japanese i-mode system
may foreshadow how other countries' wireless industries will evolve.
Reportedly, the spending on digital data transmission (much of it SMS)
by i-mode users is matched by their increased spending on voice calls.</p>

<p>As a final historical perspective, let us note that the wired
telephone industry did not attain its current role until it started to
encourage usage, especially social calls. The fascinating story of this
development is told in [<a href="#Fischer">Fischer</a>]. It is also discussed later in this paper.</p>

<p><img src="Content%20is%20Not%20King_files/quad.gif" alt="++++++++++"></p>
 <a name="o6"></a><h2>The Role of content</h2>

<p>The general conclusion is that content has been less important than
point-to-point communication in the past, including the recent past
involving the Internet. Still, the argument that "content is <i>not</i>king"
that is presented here should not be taken to an extreme. All it says
is that most of the money is in point-to-point communication. It does
not say that content does not dominate in volume of data. Historically,
as we have noted above, content has often dominated, and probably
dominates now. (There is some uncertainty, since there are difficult
questions about measuring the volumes of broadcast communications.)
There are arguments, to be presented later, that in the future, content
will not provide most of the bits traveling on the Internet. However,
even if that prediction is wrong, it will not affect the argument,
which is about value to customers, and not about volume.</p>

<p>That content is not king does not mean that content is unimportant
in shaping political or social views. The attention paid to writers,
and the political advertising on radio and TV, testify to the influence
of content. This also is not a new phenomenon. Over the centuries,
millions of people based their opinions of Richard III on Shakespeare's
play, just as today millions base their opinions of John F. Kennedy's
assassination on Oliver Stone's film.</p>

<p>The argument about the value of content says little about the dispute in early 2000 between <a href="http://disney.go.com/">Disney</a> and <a href="http://www.timewarner.com/">Time Warner</a>
over carrying ABC channels on cable TV. That issue is about division of
revenues between content creation and content distribution. The
argument of this paper is that the entire content piece of the economy
is not all that large, and its contribution to network costs is much
smaller than that of point-to-point communication. It does not deal
with how the content piece is divided.</p>

<p>Content can be profitable. Numerous media companies are doing very
well. Content can also be of value to a network, even aside from
providing traffic for the network to carry. However, it is probably
best to think of content as either catnip or icing on the cake;
something to attract new users, or enhance user experience. That is
what broadcast TV programs do for the advertisers who pay for them.
That may also have been the main role of the Web and browsers in
bringing more people to the Internet.</p>

<p><img src="Content%20is%20Not%20King_files/quad.gif" alt="++++++++++"></p>
 <a name="o7"></a><h2>The Future of the Internet</h2>

<p>What the argument that content is not king does say is that people
are willing to pay far more for point-to-point communication than for
the famed content. That is likely to be reflected in what kinds of
networks are built, and which companies succeed. It inverts the usual
ordering of priorities, making point-to-point communication central,
and content secondary. The fights over control of movie distribution
may be a distraction from the main business of communication. As a
simple example of what this may mean in practical terms, most broadband
access links, such as cable modem and DSL ones, are designed to be
asymmetrical, with higher capacity on the link to the home than to the
network. The expectation is that these connections will be used
primarily to pull content to the consumer. However, if the consumer
places much higher value on personal communication than on content, the
case for symmetrical connections becomes stronger. That may mean that
fiber to the home may be justified sooner than expected. In the
wireless arena, it suggests (as explained in an earlier section) that
for much of the next decade, the best strategy will be to emphasize
regular voice transmission, supplemented by e-mail and various
low-bandwidth data transfers. Music and video services are likely to be
delayed until much later.</p>

<p>Before continuing, it is worth considering a basic issue, namely,
what is content? This word derives from the Latin "contentum," which
means "that which is contained," but this derivation is not very
descriptive. There is no precise definition, but generally content is
used to denote material prepared by professionals to be used by large
numbers of people, material such as books, newspapers, movies, or
sports events. That is the sense in which it is used in this work. In
general, content is distributed by "mass" or "broadcast" communications
systems. Until a few decades ago, such services could be distinguished
easily from "point-to-point" (or, more precisely, "person-to-person")
communications, which included first class letters and phone calls, and
were specific to the people involved in the transaction. These two
types of communications were sometimes combined during distribution, as
in the postal system, which carried both letters and newspapers, in an
early example of "convergence." However, there was a noticeable
distinction in how these two types of communication were prepared,
handled, perceived by the recipients, and (a point discussed at great
length already) in how much people were willing to pay for them.</p>

<p>During the last few decades, the distinction between point-to-point
and broadcast communication began to blur. Computers allowed for the
mass preparation of personalized letters offering credit cards, say.
Answering machines and voice response systems led to machine-mediated
point-to-point communications. Individuals were able to reach large
audiences through postings to netnews, or, more recently, through their
personal Web pages. We can expect this evolution of communications to
continue, and eventually to achieve that convergence in which there
will be a continuum between point-to-point and broadcast communication.
However, we are not there yet, and won't be for a while.</p>

<p>In this work I do not classify information services such as weather,
directory assistance and airline schedules as content. Many of the
standard phone calls access just such services, and the Internet is
leading to increasing usage of them. I also do not classify most of
e-commerce as content. Somebody going to the <a href="http://www.godiva.com/">Godiva</a>
Web site may be exposed to creative work in the ads flashed on the
screen, but is interested in purchasing a tangible good. These types of
interactions will flourish on the Internet, and some will be merging
with content, but they are more typical of the standard point-to-point
communications.</p>

<p><img src="Content%20is%20Not%20King_files/quad.gif" alt="++++++++++"></p>
 <a name="o8"></a><h2>Rates of technological change</h2>

<p>One of the main lessons from the history of communications is that
technologies are often adopted rapidly, but seldom at the astronomical
rates that popular imagination associates with the Internet. This
applies even to the Internet, where change tends to be less rapid than
is often thought. Browsers were adopted rapidly. The first informal
release of Mosaic took place in the spring of 1993, and in under two
years, the majority of Internet traffic was Web-related. However, that
was an exception. Other changes have been slower. Just consider
Internet telephony, introduced back in 1995. It is finally beginning to
have a noticeable effect, but it is far from dominant. As another
example, Amazon.com has had a striking impact on perceptions of
e-commerce. Yet after more than six years, less than 10% of book sales
take place online, and Amazon.com's investors are learning the virtues
of patience. "Internet time" is a myth. In general, the time a new
technology takes to become widespread has not changed much in the last
half century.</p>

<p></p><blockquote>A modern maxim says: "People tend to overestimate what can be
done in one year and to underestimate what can be done in five or ten years."
(footnote on p. 17 of [<a href="#Licklider">Licklider</a>])</blockquote><p></p>

<p>Even technologies with compelling advantages tend to take a decade
to dominate markets. Fax machines took about 10 years, from the
introduction of the first inexpensive models until they became
ubiquitous. Cell phones, one of the fastest growing industries, have
taken about 15 years to reach their present level. Cable TV has taken
over three decades to reach about 60% of U.S. households. Music CDs and
more recently DVDs show similar patterns, taking on the order of a
decade to reach dominance. For more examples and a discussion of rates
of change, see [<a href="#Odlyzko1">Odlyzko1</a>]. Aside from the
unusually rapid ascendency of the browser-Web combination, fast change
is usually associated with the presence of forcing agents. These can be
either governments or a small number of key decision makers who can
shift an industry's direction. An example of such forcing agents are
the information technology managers at large banks and other
enterprises. When they decided that mainframes were obsolete, they did
so over a short period of time, and this led to a catastrophic decline
in <a href="http://www.ibm.com/">IBM's</a> fortunes. A transition of
voice phone traffic from circuit switched transmission to the Internet
might occur rapidly for just this reason. The carriers might be able to
implement it rapidly, since it could be done essentially invisibly to
the end users, and the decisions would need to be made by only a few
people.</p>

<p>The decade-long diffusion periods listed above for consumer goods
and services are due to the inertia of the millions of people who have
to individually decide to adopt a new technology. Most new products and
services are in that category. Sociological changes are even slower,
taking a generation or two. Normal change, with a simple shift in
technology that offers serious advantages over older, more established
competitor (as with CDs over vinyl records, which provided higher
quality sound reproduction, or cell phones, which offered mobility,
even at the cost of sound quality), takes on the order of a decade.</p>

<p><img src="Content%20is%20Not%20King_files/quad.gif" alt="++++++++++"></p>
 <a name="o9"></a><h2>Content in the future</h2>

<p>The speed with which new technologies diffuse has a direct relevance
for the question of whether content might be king of the Internet. It
is possible to make a case that even if content is not king now, it
might be king in the future, when convergence does occur. Some evidence
for this can be derived from the comparison of cable TV and cell phone
industries. Their revenues and growth rates were cited as demonstrating
that point-to-point communication is more important than content.
However, there is another way to look at the data. As was mentioned,
about a third of the cable TV revenues go to pay for content. What that
means is that two thirds pay for the network. (According to some
reports, carriers receive up to 90% of the revenues from some content,
such as hard-core pornography pay-per-view movies.) If convergence
moves delivery of most of the content to the Internet, and transport
grabs two thirds of the total revenues from content, then the network
will get a huge new source of revenue. Total content spending in the
U.S. is comparable to that on the phone system, so two thirds of that 
would make a huge difference to network financing. This scenario is not
totally implausible, since the current content distribution system is
grossly inefficient. Book authors and musicians typically receive in
royalties less than a tenth of the price consumers pay for their
creations. It is a striking observation that a participant in
Amazon.com's affiliate program can sometimes get more money from a book
sale generated by a link from his or her home page than the author does
from royalties! The Internet offers a chance to reduce some of the
inefficiencies of the current system. For the current dominant content
producers, the real threat from the Internet is probably less from
piracy, and more from disintermediation. New producers can come in and,
unburdened by the high overheads and obsolete habits of established
players, can offer better deals to both the creative talent and the
consumers.</p>

<p>The scenario outlined above, in which Internet transport grabs the
lion's share of revenues from content, is conceivable, but very
unlikely. One argument against this scenario is based on a simple
historical observation. No broadcast medium has ever been replaced by
another; despite predictions to the contrary at various times in the
past, newspapers were not killed by radio, nor radio by television.
However, that argument may not be valid. The Internet is a disruptive
technology, it does have unprecedented ability to emulate other
delivery mechanisms, and we are already seeing rapid growth in music
delivery on it. As an example of what can happen to even the most
solid-seeming businesses, just consider the <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica.</i>
(Its problems started even in the pre-Internet days, with CD-ROMs.) In
spite of having the greatest brand name and by far the best content in
the encyclopedia field, it has been floundering, and has yet to find a
viable business model. Thus dramatic changes are indeed possible in the
electronic environment. Still, there are other, more substantial,
arguments against the content thesis.</p>

<p>The Internet will surely have a major impact on the content
industries. However, as was discussed above, consumers are slow to
change their behavior. Even the <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i> has had
more than a decade in which to flounder. Couch potatoes are not going
to abandon their TV sets right away, especially when computer and cable
TV penetrations in the U.S. are under two thirds of households, and not
growing rapidly. Even in the business environment, adoption of new
technologies that require a thorough re-engineering of all internal
processes is slow. The business-to-consumer dot-coms have discovered
this already, and the business-to-business ones are in the process of
learning. Although we are living in the Internet era, fundamental
change is not all that much faster than a century and a half ago. The
adoption of the telegraph by railroads, discussed in Section 13 of [<a href="#Odlyzko3">Odlyzko3</a>], did lead to huge efficiency gains, but it was slow as well.</p>

<p>Slow adoption of new technologies means that convergence will be
spread over a decade or more, and there will be continuing competition
from traditional media, as well as increasing diversity of delivery
mechanisms for content. This may mean that writers and artists will get
a bigger share of the pie. That appears to have been the trend over the
last few decades, with movie actors and professional sport stars
increasing their share of the revenues their work brings in. It is less
certain whether carriers will manage to improve their share of the
content pie to the same extent. There will certainly be a shift of
revenue towards broadband services, but content distribution may not be
the largest contributor to it.</p>

<p>The main reason to question whether content will ever make giant
contributions to network costs is that by the time convergence is
likely to occur, at least a decade into the future, content
transmission is likely to be a small fraction of total traffic.
Further, most content will probably be distributed as ordinary file
transfers, not in real-time mode. The various rates of growth that
contribute to these predictions are discussed later. Right now we note
that if these predictions come true, then it will be hard for networks
to charge much for the transport of content. High prices could be
charged for content distribution if content made up most of the
traffic, or else if content required special transmission quality (such
as that needed for real-time streaming traffic). Since neither of these
conditions is likely to be satisfied, though, content will probably
constitute just some of the huge number of large files, many encrypted,
that will be flying around the network. How could carriers pick out the
content files for special pricing?</p>

<p>Let us next consider the predictions for Internet traffic mentioned
in the preceding paragraph. I will treat them briefly, and refer the
reader to [<a href="#CoffmanO2">CoffmanO2</a>] for more detail.
Internet backbone traffic appears to be about doubling each year.
Further, advances in photonics and additional fiber deployment appear
to allow for a doubling of network capacity each year for the next
decade. In early 2000, Internet backbone traffic in the U.S. appeared
to be less than a third of voice traffic in volume, but is likely to
become larger by about 2002, with the transition point slightly later
for the rest of the world. However, if voice traffic were to be
packetized, it would almost surely be compressed, and then its volume
would already be less than that of Internet traffic (at least in the
U.S.). Broadcast TV would still overwhelm the Internet of the year
2000, but at 100% annual growth rates, it will not be too long before
there is more than enough capacity to provide a high quality video
channel for every person on Earth. This is because bandwidth that is
likely to be required to satisfy any single person's real-time
transmission needs will not be increasing fast.</p>
  <p>The versions
of Moore's Law that hold in different industries operate at diverse
rates. Microprocessors are doubling in computing power every 18 to 24
months, while fiber transmission capacity is doubling every year. On
the other hand, display technology is advancing extremely slowly.
Broadcast TV resolution has been static for several decades, and even
the planned move to HDTV will require only a modest increase in
bandwidth. Thus satisfying the needs for real-time multimedia
transmission will not require much of the Internet's capacity.</p>

<p>Content is likely to form only a small fraction of Internet traffic
for reasons explained above. In addition, real-time delivery of content
is likely to be an even smaller factor, for reasons discussed in much
greater detail in [<a href="#CoffmanO2">CoffmanO2</a>].
Transmission capacity is approximately doubling each year, which is a
much faster rate of improvement than Moore's Law for semiconductors.
However, hard disk storage capacity is also about doubling each year.
Furthermore, that capacity is already huge. At the beginning of 2000,
the U.S. Internet backbones appeared to be carrying about 12,000 TB
(terabytes) of traffic each month. However, the total world hard disk
capacity was 3,000,000 TB. Thus it would take about 20 years to
transmit all the data on those disks over U.S. Internet backbones.
Nobody proposes to do that (and why would anyone want to send all the
duplicate copies of Windows 98 around, in any case?), but this
comparison helps in visualizing the technology landscape. The presence
of huge local storage capacity in local PCs or cable TV setup boxes
will make it much more attractive to send even content as files, not as
real time transmissions. There will be a growing volume for real time
multimedia traffic, for applications such as videoconferencing.
However, such applications are likely to be swamped by ordinary file
transfers. The dominant mode of operation is likely to be fast
(eventually much faster than real time, but initially often slow)
download to local storage, fast transfer to whatever display device one
wishes to use (often a mobile information appliance), and then
playback. That is already the model we see emerging with <a href="http://www.mp3.com/">MP3</a>, Napster, and <a href="http://www.tivo.com/">TiVo</a>.
The advantages of this model include the ability to implement it now,
before the Internet can be made ready for real-time streaming media. It
also accommodates gracefully the forecasted explosive growth in small
mobile devices, which will often have small storage and low bandwidth
over wireless links, and thus will be most useful if they can get data
from local storage. This model also allows for easy integration with

<p>That real-time multimedia traffic would not dominate the Internet
has been predicted several times in the past. It is an obvious
conclusion from the rapid increase in traffic. Already the authors of [<a href="#deSolaPITH">deSolaPITH</a>]
noted that in the early 1980s data traffic was growing much faster than
voice communication. They observed that if that trend continued,
eventually most transmissions would not be seen by human eyes nor heard
by human ears. In a similar vein, in discussing general digital data
volumes in 1997, Michael Lesk predicted that "the typical piece of
information will <i>never</i>be looked at by a human being" [<a href="#Lesk">Lesk</a>].
Bill St. Arnaud appears to have been the first one to predict in the
specific context of the Internet that the general expectations for
streaming multimedia domination were unlikely to come true [<a href="#StArnaud">StArnaud</a>]. Further arguments were presented in [<a href="#Odlyzko2">Odlyzko2</a>].</p>

<p>The huge volume of local storage will surely stimulate the
generation of non-content traffic. Both corporations and individuals so
far have had no difficulty filling their disks with data. We can
expect this to continue, although predicting the exact source of that
data is uncertain. For firms, various databases will likely continue to
proliferate and grow. For residential users, pictures are the leading
candidates for filling those disks. Ease of use, lower cost, and
instant gratification all stimulate use, and digital camera owners
appear to be taking many more pictures than they ever did with regular
film. The same electronic technology that is producing better disks and
processors is also producing better cameras. Historically, it appears
that privately taken pictures have traditionally been the dominant
source of data. An interesting accounting of all the information stored
in the world in 1997 by Michael Lesk [<a href="#Lesk">Lesk</a>] found that home photographs were the dominant component. (For a more complete and up-to-date accounting of information, see [<a href="#LymanV">LymanV</a>]].)
They contributed about 500,000 TB each year (even when one assumes that
each picture is stored as a modest 10 KB JPEG file). By comparison, all
the texts in the <a href="http://www.loc.gov/">Library of Congress</a>
amounted to around 20 TB, while the graphics and music in that
collection came to about 3,000 TB. Thus even this great library
contained less than 1% of the world's information. (The publicly
accessible Web pages currently contain a few tens of terabytes, just a
few percent of what the <a href="http://www.loc.gov/">Library of Congress</a> has, but comparable to the text collections in that library.)</p>

<p>An obvious comment to the estimates above is that the purpose of a
library is to select the most valuable material, and that most of those
photographs contributing to the 500,000 TB are of no interest to most
people. That is true, but that does not stop those pictures from being
taken, and it will not stop an explosion in volumes of data collected
this way in the future. A few pictures or video clips will turn out to
be of great interest, in spite of amateur production. Just think of the
Zapruder film of the JFK assassination, or the Rodney King video. More
importantly, many of the pictures being taken are of interest, or might
be of potential interest, to at least one person. Most of the world
will have no interest in a picture of your newborn baby, but your
mother will cherish it. Similarly, in the future you will be taking
digital video clips of your children and sending at least some of them
to your mother. Many of the video shots will intentionally be made with
the hope of that nobody will want to see them, as with security
monitors. (Note that some of the earliest applications of miniature
taperecorders and video cameras has been to snoop on child care
providers. There are obvious privacy implications of current and future
camera technologies that are not pursued here, but are discussed in [<a href="#Garfinkel">Garfinkel</a>], for example.)</p>

<p>Other examples of data that may be filling our disks are suggested by the entry in <a href="#tab1">Table 1</a>
for sporting goods. Spending in this area comes to about half of
consumer spending on content, showing how highly these products are
valued. One can easily imagine future generations of body and equipment
sensors that would record precisely all details of a player's movements
in tennis, say. These details would then be fed into systems that would
analyze the motions, compare them with previous games, and produce high
quality graphical displays to help improve the player's game. There is
practically no bound on the amount of data that could be generated this
way.</p>

<p>The data that will be generated is likely to be shared using
programs descended from Napster. E-mail and the Web may not be flexible
enough. Napster is currently attracting huge attention  because of the
threat it poses to conventional music distribution channels. However,
that may turn to be less important than its ability to facilitate
sharing of files. Napster itself is too limited, as it is designed to
handle just MP3 music files, and is also centralized. Yet it has
already inspired creation of tools such as Gnutella, which are much
more general and decentralized. Given the growth of local storage, and
the increasing availability of tools to fill that storage with video
clips and other material, it is possible that tools like Gnutella may
become more important to the Internet than the Web.</p>

<p><img src="Content%20is%20Not%20King_files/quad.gif" alt="++++++++++"></p>
 <a name="o10"></a><h2>Value of social interactions</h2>

<p>The discussion above is futurology. We cannot be certain how the
Internet will evolve. However, history teaches us several lessons. One
is that the growing storage and communication capacities will be used,
often in unexpected ways. (For a careful study of the many early
predictions about the future of the telephone, and the actual evolution
of that service, see [<a href="#deSolaP1">deSolaP1</a>; <a href="#deSolaP2">deSolaP2</a>],
for example.) Another important lesson is that the value of the myriad
social interactions has often been underestimated. Only a tiny fraction
of the information passing through communications systems has ever been
high quality scholarly knowledge. Even in more prosaic transmissions,
we have moved from Samuel Morse's solemn "What hath God wrought?" to
Alexander Graham Bell's utilitarian "Mr. Watson, come here, I want
you," to the banal "How was your lunch?" that is so common today. The
volume of communication has increased, the importance of a typical
message has decreased, and the attention we pay to such a typical
message has decreased. However, the aggregate value of all these
exchanges has increased.</p>

<p>Sociability was frequently dismissed as idle gossip, and especially
in the early days of the telephone, was actively discouraged. For
example, a 1909 study of telephone service commissioned by the city of
Chicago advocated measured rate service as a way to reduce "useless
calls" [<a href="#JacksonCW">JacksonCW</a>]. Yet the most successful
communication technologies, the mail and the telephone, reached their
full potential only when they embraced sociability and those "useless
calls" as their goal [<a href="#Fischer">Fischer</a>]. That seemingly
idle chit-chat not only provided direct revenues, but it encouraged the
diffusion of the corresponding technology, and made it more useful for
commercial and other applications. Such social interaction frequently
function to grease the wheels of commerce.</p>

<p>This work is based on a more extensive study [<a href="#Odlyzko3">Odlyzko3</a>]
of the development of the communications infrastructure from the point
of view of the user. Usually an infrastructure is noted for being
unnoticed; it is simply there, something we come to rely upon, do not
have to think much about, and are horribly inconvenienced when it
malfunctions. Electricity, water, mail, and the phone are excellent
examples. Yet they all took much effort to reach this stage. The key
failing of the telegraph was that it never became a true infrastructure
component. It was a revolutionary technology, the "Victorian Internet,"
as one writer has called it [<a href="#Standage">Standage</a>], but it
was too cumbersome and too expensive to attract much usage, and in
particular never carried much of that "useless" social traffic that
pushed the mail and the telephone to their eminent positions.</p>

<p><img src="Content%20is%20Not%20King_files/quad.gif" alt="++++++++++"></p>
 <a name="o11"></a><h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>Although social uses are important to the the telephone industry, a glance at <a href="#tab1">Table 1</a>
shows that most of the revenues come from businesses. Household spending
on phone service brings in only about a third of the total revenues.
(The figures for total revenues, $256 billion in 1997, and consumer
spending, $85 billion, come from different sources. It is possible that
consumers spend somewhat more, especially for cell phones, than is
reported in the $85 billion figure. However, even if one makes the most
likely adjustments, it still appears that business spending on
telephony is far larger than that of households.) That has been the
historical trend, and many communication services, including the phone,
were initially devoted almost totally to business uses. Traditionally,
commercial users have subsidized residential ones. Sometimes this was
done involuntarily, as in higher rates dictated by carriers or by
government regulators, and sometimes voluntarily, as in paying for
toll-free 800 numbers. It appears probable that similar subsidies will
also play a large role on the Internet. (That is also why toll-free
numbers for wireless calls may be very important.) We may very well end
up with a system in which the largest monetary contribution will come
from commercial users, the second largest for households paying for
point-to-point communication, and the smallest by the transport
component of charges for content.</p>

<p>The value of a broadcast network is usually regarded as proportional
to the number of users in it. On the other hand, a point-to-point
communication network is often said, by Metcalfe's Law, to have value
proportional to the square of the number of member. This then leads to
the conclusion that eventually, once a single network like the Internet
reaches a large enough size, point-to-point communications will provide
much higher value than broadcast. There are some problems with this
argument. (See [<a href="#Odlyzko3">Odlyzko3</a>]
for detailed arguments.) In particular, Metcalfe's Law does not reflect
properly several other important factors that go into determining the
value of a network. However, the general thrust of the argument and the
conclusion are valid. Certainly all the historical evidence cited
throughout this work supports the conclusion that connectivity (or
point-to-point communication) is what matters the most.</p>

<p>Since connectivity matters the most, and voice usage in cellular
systems is low, the main function of 3G wireless systems is likely to
be in stimulating more voice calls. Content data services are likely to
function primarily as enticements to induce more voice usage. True
wireless broadband data access is likely to have to wait until 4G
systems arrive, at which time the potential for increased voice usage
is likely to be exhausted.</p>

<p>General connectivity is likely to lead to demands for symmetrical
links on the Internet. Hence fiber to the home may be needed sooner
than is generally expected.</p>

<p>Whether content is king or not has direct relevance for the question
of whether the Internet will continue to be an open network, or whether
it will be balkanized. If content were to dominate, then the Internet
would be primarily a broadcast network. With value proportional to the
number of users, there would be few inherent advantages to an open
network. The sum of the values of several completely or partially
separate networks would be the same as of a unified network. On the
other hand, if point-to-point communications were to dominate, and if
Metcalfe's Law were to hold, there would be strong economic incentives
to a unified network without barriers. This is considered more fully in
Section 4 of [<a href="#Odlyzko3">Odlyzko3</a>].
The general conclusion there is that even though Metcalfe's Law is not
fully valid, the incentives to maintain an open network are likely to
be very strong. This will be largely because content is not king, and
effective point-to-point communication will demand easy interconnection.</p>

<p>An extreme form of the "content is king" position, but one that is
shared by many people, and not just in the content industry, was
expressed recently by the head of a major music producer and
distributor:</p>

<p></p><blockquote>What would the Internet be without "content?" It
would be a valueless collection of silent machines with gray screens.
It would be the electronic equivalent of a marine desert - lovely
elements, nice colors, no life. It would be nothing. [<a href="#Bronfman">Bronfman</a>]</blockquote><p></p>

<p>The author of this claim is facing the possible collapse of his
business model. Therefore it is natural for him to believe this claim,
and to demand (in the rest of the speech [<a href="#Bronfman">Bronfman</a>]) that
the Internet be designed to allow content producers to continue their
current mode of operation. However, while one can admire the poetic
language of this claim, all the evidence of this paper shows the claim
itself is wrong. Content has never been king, it is not king now, and
is unlikely to ever be king. The Internet has done quite well without
content, and can continue to flourish without it. Content will have a
place on the Internet, possibly a substantial place. However, its place
will likely be subordinate to that of business and personal
communication.<img src="Content%20is%20Not%20King_files/endof.gif" alt="End of article"></p>
